// Check if the type of a variable is integer   
$x = 5985;

2, 256, -256, 10358, -179567 are all integers. While 7.56, 10.0, 150.67 are floats.

So, an integer data type is a non-decimal number between -2147483648 and 2147483647. A value greater (or lower) than this, will be stored as float, because it exceeds the limit of an integer.

Another important thing to know is that even if 4 * 2.5 is 10, the result is stored as float, because one of the operands is a float (2.5).

Here are some rules for integers:

An integer must have at least one digit
An integer must not have a decimal point
An integer can be either positive or negative
Integers can be specified in three formats: decimal (10-based), hexadecimal (16-based - prefixed with 0x) or octal (8-based - prefixed with 0)
PHP has the following functions to check if the type of a variable is integer:

is_int()
is_integer() - alias of is_int()
is_long() - alias of is_int()
